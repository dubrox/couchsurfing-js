# Couchsurfing JS client

Based on https://github.com/nderkach/couchsurfing-python 
with the idea of bringing some useful features from the apps
to the web, the hosting calendar being my main target. 

This project is still a work in progress, but I decided
to share it so that the community can get advantage of it
or collaborate.
